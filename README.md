# Verilog Learning Repository

This repository contains Verilog HDL codes and simulations as part of my learning journey in digital system design and embedded hardware.

## ðŸ›  Topics Covered
- Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)
- Multiplexers & Demultiplexers
- Encoders & Decoders
- Flip-Flops (D, T, JK, SR)
- Counters (up, down, ring)
